# Even Or Odd

An easy [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe) to create a funcion that retuns whether a number is even or odd.

## Notes

**Haskell**
I started this one in haskell. I learned that pattern matching and recursion were appropriate tools to solve the given problem. I also learned how to implement tests in haskell using HUnit so I could confirm the function I wrote worked correctly.
