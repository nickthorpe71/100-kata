# Even Or Odd

An easy [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe) to create a funcion that retuns whether a number is even or odd.

## Notes

**Haskell**
I started this one in haskell. I learned that pattern matching and recursion were appropriate tools to solve the given problem. I also learned how to implement tests in haskell using HUnit so I could confirm the function I wrote worked correctly. 

**C**
Next up was C. To solve the problem was easy using the modulo operator but I did learn about the `const` keyword in C which is used to declare a constant which means the data the pointer is pointing to is immutable.
