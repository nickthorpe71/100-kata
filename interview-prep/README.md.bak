# Interview Prep - Rust R* Style

A collection of 30 coding interview problems designed to prepare for senior software engineering interviews, implemented in Rust following R* principles.

## Philosophy
- **No hints in problem names** - Figure out the approach yourself
- **R* Rust style** - Minimal dependencies, functional leaning, explicit naming
- **Adaptive learning** - More problems generated based on struggle areas
- **Real interview simulation** - 45-60 minute sessions with time pressure

### Supplemental Problems (0 Complete)
_Problems will be added here based on areas needing reinforcement_

## Session Format
1. **Problem** (2 min) - Read and understand
2. **Clarify** (5 min) - Ask about constraints and edge cases  
3. **Approach** (10 min) - Design your solution
4. **Code** (25 min) - Implement in R* style Rust
5. **Test** (8 min) - Verify with test cases
6. **Analyze** (5 min) - Complexity discussion
7. **Review** (5 min) - What could be better?

## R* Principles Reminder
- **Zero external dependencies** - stdlib only
- **Functional when clear** - Iterators over loops
- **Explicit naming** - `find_maximum_subarray` not `max_sub`
- **Minimal mutability** - Only when necessary
- **No magic** - Clear over clever

## Study Areas Tracking

### Strengths
_To be filled as you progress_

### Growth Areas  
_To be filled as you progress_

### Rust-Specific Learning
- [ ] Ownership patterns
- [ ] Lifetime management
- [ ] Iterator chains
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Zero-copy techniques
- [ ] Smart pointers usage

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick a problem randomly** - Don't look at the order
2. **Set a timer for 45 minutes**
3. **Solve without looking at hints**
4. **Ask Claude Code to act as interviewer** using MUSASHI_COACH.md
5. **Track your progress** in this README
6. **Note struggle areas** for supplemental practice

## Interview Tips
- Always clarify requirements first
- Start with brute force if optimal isn't obvious
- Think out loud - explain your reasoning
- Write tests as you go
- Know your complexity analysis
- Clean code > clever code
