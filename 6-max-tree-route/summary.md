# Max Binary Tree Route

This [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e5279b7cf1aea5cf000359) was a nice change of pace as it involved traversing a binary tree. 


**JS** 
Once again I started with JS. It seems like I either need to get better with one of the languages to feel confortable using those while I think through the problem or just accept that JS will remain the first language. 

**C**
Was able to get some more practice and a better understanding in allocating and freeing memory with this exercise. I would like to start the next problem with C as it seems to help me visualize an image of how the data is passed and structured.
