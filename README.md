### 1A. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and every other node has a parent and zero or more child nodes. In a tree, there are no cycles, meaning no node can be re-visited as you traverse from the root to any other node.

Trees do not contain cycles.

##### Why are Trees Useful?

Trees are versatile data structures useful for various reasons:

-   **Hierarchical Data Representation:** Trees are ideal for representing hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational structures, XML/HTML data, and more.
-   **Efficient Search and Manipulation:** Trees allow for efficient searching and manipulation of data.
-   **Database Indexing:** Trees are used in database indexing (B-trees, B+ trees) to enable quick data retrieval.
-   **Decision Making:** Used in decision-making processes, such as decision trees in machine learning algorithms.

#### 1Aa. Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure is a subset of a more general tree structure, which can have any number of children. Binary trees are more structured than general trees, which means algorithms on binary trees can be more efficient due to this known structure.

##### Why are Binary Trees Useful?

Binary trees are particularly useful for several reasons:

-   **Efficient Searching:** Binary Search Trees (BST), a type of binary tree, allow for efficient searching of elements. In a balanced BST, operations like search, insert, and delete can be performed in O(log n) time.
-   **Data Representation:** They are used to represent data with hierarchical relationships, like file systems or organizational structures.
-   **Sorting and Traversal:** They are used in various sorting algorithms like tree sort. Traversal operations help in processing or searching for data in a specific order.
-   **Efficient Data Access:** In structures like binary heaps, binary trees are used to implement priority queues, allowing for efficient access to the highest or lowest priority item.

##### Traversal Methods and Their Usefulness

Traversal in binary trees is the process of visiting each node in the tree in a specific order. The primary traversal methods are:

-   **In-Order Traversal:** Visits left subtree, root, and right subtree. Useful for getting elements in sorted order in a BST.
-   **Pre-Order Traversal:** Visits root, left subtree, then right subtree. Useful for copying the tree or prefix expression evaluations.
-   **Post-Order Traversal:** Visits left subtree, right subtree, and then the root. Useful for postfix expression evaluations and certain tree deletion processes.
-   **Level-Order Traversal:** Visits nodes level by level. Useful for breadth-first search scenarios like finding the shortest path in some applications.

##### Examples

```js
/**
 * Calculates the maximum sum from the root to any leaf node in a binary tree.
 * This function uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all paths
 * from the root to the leaf nodes. It recursively traverses the tree, aggregating
 * sums along each path, and returns the maximum sum encountered.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root - The root node of the binary tree.
 * @return {number} The maximum sum from the root to any leaf node.
 */
function maxSum(root) {
    // Base case: If the current node is null, return 0
    if (root === null) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Case for leaf nodes: If both left and right children are null, return the node's value
    if (root.left === null && root.right === null) {
        return root.value;
    }

    // Recursive case: Calculate the max sum of the left and right subtrees
    // If a subtree is null, treat its max sum as -Infinity
    const leftMaxSum = root.left ? maxSum(root.left) : -Infinity;
    const rightMaxSum = root.right ? maxSum(root.right) : -Infinity;

    // Return the node's value plus the greater of the max sums from the left and right subtrees
    return root.value + Math.max(leftMaxSum, rightMaxSum);
}
```

## 2. Number Theory

### 2A. Prime Numbers

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, it cannot be evenly divided by any other number except 1 and the number itself.

### 2B. Digit Sums

Digit sum calculation refers to the process of summing up the individual digits of a given integer. For example, for the integer 456, the digit sum is calculated as `4+5+6=15`. In numerical analysis and computational mathematics, digit sums may be used as a tool for understanding the behavior of numerical algorithms and their results. They can help identify regularities or anomalies in numerical data.

##### Primary Use: Data Integrity

Digit sums are often used to validate and verify numerical data, ensuring its accuracy and integrity. By summing the individual digits of a number, digit sums provide a simple yet effective way to catch errors, detect discrepancies, and maintain data reliability in various applications, from credit card number validation to barcode verification.

##### Examples

```js
function calculateDigitSum(number) {
    // Calculate the digit sum of a number
    return number
        .toString()
        .split("")
        .reduce((sum, digit) => sum + parseInt(digit), 0);
}

function validateCreditCardNumber(cardNumber) {
    // Remove spaces and non-digit characters from the card number
    const cleanCardNumber = cardNumber.replace(/\D/g, "");

    // Check if the card number is a valid length (e.g., 16 digits for most credit cards)
    if (cleanCardNumber.length !== 16) {
        return false;
    }

    // Calculate the digit sum of the card number
    const digitSum = calculateDigitSum(cleanCardNumber);

    // Check if the digit sum is divisible by 10 (a common credit card validation criterion)
    if (digitSum % 10 === 0) {
        return true; // Valid credit card number
    } else {
        return false; // Invalid credit card number
    }
}

// Example usage:
const creditCardNumber = "1234 5678 9012 3456";
const isValid = validateCreditCardNumber(creditCardNumber);

if (isValid) {
    console.log("Credit card number is valid.");
} else {
    console.log("Credit card number is invalid.");
}
```

### 2C. Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries. It involves constructing and analyzing protocols to prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Its origins are in the construction and analysis of codes and ciphers, but modern cryptography encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies.

#### 2CA. Hash Functions

Hash functions originated from the need to efficiently store and retrieve data. The concept of hashing emerged in the 1950s, primarily for searching records in databases.
The term "hash" supposedly derives from the process of chopping and mixing, indicative of how hash functions scramble data.

In data structures like hash tables or hash maps, hash functions are used to map data of arbitrary size (like strings, files, etc.) to data of fixed size (like an array index).
They are fundamental in implementing associative arrays, database indexing, cache designs, and more.

##### Uses of Hash Functions

-   **Data Retrieval:** The primary use in data structures is to quickly locate a data record given its search key.
-   **Load Balancing:** By hashing requests to servers, systems can balance loads across multiple resources.
-   **Unique Identifier Generation:** Hash functions can generate unique identifiers for large sets of data.
-   **Cryptography:** Ensuring data integrity, securing sensitive data, authenticating messages, and digital signature generation.
-   **Checksums and Data Integrity:** Hash functions are used to generate checksums to verify data integrity during transmission or storage.
-   **Bloom Filters:** They are used in Bloom filters for checking the presence of an element in a set efficiently.
-   **Proof of Work in Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use hash functions in their proof-of-work algorithms to maintain the blockchain.
-   **Cache Hashing:** In caching systems, hash functions help to determine where to store data fragments so they can be retrieved efficiently.

##### Implementation

Implementing a hash function in JavaScript involves creating a function that takes an input (usually a string) and returns a hash value, which is typically a number. This hash value is calculated in such a way that it's uniformly distributed for different inputs, and the same input will always produce the same hash value.

##### Basic Principles of a Hash Function

-   **Uniform Distribution:** The hash function should distribute hash values uniformly across the output range to minimize collisions.
-   **Deterministic:** The same input should always yield the same hash value.
-   **Efficient to Compute:** The function should be fast to compute.
-   **Avalanche Effect (for cryptographic hash functions):** A small change in input should produce a significantly different hash value.

##### Examples

```js
// Simple
function simpleHash(input) {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        const char = input.charCodeAt(i);
        hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
        hash = hash & hash; // Convert to 32bit integer
    }
    return hash;
}
```

```js
// Robust (SHA-256 hash)

// SHA-256 implementation in JavaScript (simplified and for educational purposes only)

/*
This code snippet illustrates the basic structure of SHA-256, but it omits many of the detailed steps for brevity. The full SHA-256 algorithm involves creating a message schedule, performing a series of bitwise operations, and using a set of constants (k), which are derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes. Additionally, there are multiple rounds of processing the message block.
*/
function rightRotate(value, amount) {
    return (value >>> amount) | (value << (32 - amount));
