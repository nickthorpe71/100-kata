# 100 Kata

- Find a code wars / leet code problem and solve it in C, Haskell, JS, and Prolog. The goal is to understand different programming paradigms and extract lessons from each. 

- C: Imperitvive
- Haskell: Functional
- Prolog: Logical
- JS: Multi Paradigm

- Start with very easy problems and increase difficulty over time.

## Run

### Prolog
`swipl -q -l <file_name>.pl`

### C
`gcc -o <exe_name> <file_name>.c`

### JS
`node <file-name>.js`

### Haskell
`ghc -o <FileName> <FileName>.hs`
