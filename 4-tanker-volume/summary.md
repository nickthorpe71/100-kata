# Tanker Fuel Volume

[Today's kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f3da49e83ca1ddae0000ad) was more math focused than data structure and/or algorithm focused. I wanted to try this as an experiment to see how haskell and prolog would differ from c/js. Full transparency, I had to research the underlying math and still don't have a full understanding.

**JS** 
Started with JS again to make sure I had a working solution before trying to implement in other languages. I think I need to start with a different language (probably haskell) next time to force myself to understand how to start from a different perspective.
