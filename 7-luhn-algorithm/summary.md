# Lunhn Algorithm

[The seventh kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5418a1dd6d8216e18a0012b2/c) was an implementation of an algorithm used to validate id numbers such as credit card numbers. 

**C**
Started this one in C. It was a great change of pace and I was really proud that I was able to think through and write out the solution in C without outside assistance other than looking up how to clone and int array. The nice part about starting with C is that I was able to really see the implementation details. When I saw the finished solution I realized I didn't approach this in a traditional "C" way. Instead I broke the problem down into many functions. My solution was much longer and likely a bit less effecient than the optimal solution. That being said, mine also created a bunch of reusable functions for int arrays. For a coding challenge I think the optimal solution in code wars is better but it was interesting to compare.
